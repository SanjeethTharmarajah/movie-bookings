# Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

A group project to utilize 2 API's in the application

## User Story

Book a Movie is a one-stop booking application where the user can search up any movie and book a ticket instantly! It will give the user details about the movie like the movie title, release date, ratings, and cast, using the OMDb API. Further, the user can view the trailer of the movie which will be displayed using Youtube API. The user will simply have to click on the “Book Ticket” button and a modal will pop up where they can input their name, movie date, time and location to book the movie ticket.

The site will contain two pages: the landing page for the user to search up the movies and the Booking History page which will show all their previous movie bookings. The pages will be built using HTML and styled using CSS, Materelize CSS and Jquery UI. Javascript will be utilized to incorporate the functionality of the site. The Booking details from the modal will be saved in the site under local storage.
